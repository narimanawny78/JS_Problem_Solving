//Problem 

/*
After a hard quarter in the office you decide to get some rest on a vacation. So you will book a flight for you and your girlfriend and try to leave all the mess behind you.

You will need a rental car in order for you to get around in your vacation. The manager of the car rental makes you some good offers.

Every day you rent the car costs $40. If you rent the car for 7 or more days, you get $50 off your total. Alternatively, if you rent the car for 3 or more days, you get $20 off your total.

Write a code that gives out the total amount for different days(d).

*/

//Solution

//Define the price
//Check if the Days less than 3 Return the price
//Check if the Days more than 7 Return the price -50
//Else Price - 20


// function rentalCarCost(d) {
//   let price = 40 * d;
//   if (d < 3) return price;
//   if (d >= 7) {
//     return price -50;
//   } else {
//     return price -20;
//   }
// }

// console.log(rentalCarCost(7));

//Another Solution

function rentalCarCost(d) {
  let price = 40 * d;
  if (d < 3) return price;
  return d >= 7 ?  price -50 :  price -20;
}

console.log(rentalCarCost(3));
